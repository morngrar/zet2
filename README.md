# zet2 - the new iteration of my unfinished zet command

Bonzai is unstable at the moment, and the level of abstraction I had created in
the other repo represented too much friction to get anything done. I'm
implementing a runnable and debuggable prototype here, and pulling in any
relevant code before deleting the old and renaming this one.

Sometimes, starting from scratch is better.
